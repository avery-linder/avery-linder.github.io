    "title": "Do More Shots or More Accurate Shots Produce More Goals in the NHL?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In hockey, it’s easy to assume that the team with the most shots or the most goals will dominate the whole season. Fans, journalists, and even some players often measure a team’s success by their offensive output, because more shots should lead to more goals, right?\nBut in reality, in order to win the Stanley Cup teams must have a balanced offense with efficiency, strong defensive play, and depth to succeed in the league.\nOver the past five seasons, the league has had some interesting patterns. Some teams have high shot totals but they don’t always lead in goals or wins. Whereas, a few teams have moderate shot totals and often rank near the top of shooting efficiency, and sometimes championships.\nThis raises a key question: what matters more in the NHL? Shot volume or shooting accuracy? Or is it a combination of different factors that separates top teams from the rest?\nFirst, let’s look at shooting accuracy. Some teams score more efficiently than others, making each shot count. This efficiency can separate good teams from great ones and often explains why some teams succeed even without taking the most shots.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(wehoop)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(rvest)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\nstats &lt;- read_csv(\"SPMC 350 Project #2 Data - Sheet1.csv\")\n\nstats |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    ShootingPct = `GF/GP` / `Shots/GP`\n    ) |&gt;\n  select(Team, ShootingPct) |&gt;\n  top_n(10, wt=ShootingPct) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(ShootingPct)) |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    Team = \"Team\",\n    ShootingPct = \"Shooting %\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  fmt_percent(\n    columns = c(ShootingPct),\n    decimals = 1\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"The NHL Teams Making Their Shots Count\",\n    subtitle = \"The Capitals and Lightning convert their shots into goals at the highest rate, highlighting the value of shooting accuracy.\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"Data as of Dec. 2. | **By:** Avery Linder  |  **Source:** Hockey Reference\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#002868\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Team == \"Tampa Bay Lightning\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#C8102E\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Team == \"Washington Capitals\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#FF474C\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Team == \"Chicago Blackhawks\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NHL Teams Making Their Shots Count\n\n\nThe Capitals and Lightning convert their shots into goals at the highest rate, highlighting the value of shooting accuracy.\n\n\nTeam\nShooting %\n\n\n\n\nWashington Capitals\n12.6%\n\n\nTampa Bay Lightning\n12.5%\n\n\nWinnipeg Jets\n11.9%\n\n\nDallas Stars\n11.8%\n\n\nToronto Maple Leafs\n11.6%\n\n\nBuffalo Sabres\n11.6%\n\n\nMontréal Canadiens\n11.6%\n\n\nSt. Louis Blues\n11.4%\n\n\nColumbus Blue Jackets\n11.2%\n\n\nChicago Blackhawks\n11.1%\n\n\n\nData as of Dec. 2. | By: Avery Linder | Source: Hockey Reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile shooting accuracy highlights which teams make the most of their opportunities, it doesn’t tell the full story.

For example, the Florida Panthers, are ranked 28th out of 32 teams in shooting efficiency, yet they’ve won the Stanley Cup twice in the past five years This shows that while scoring efficiently helps, balanced team play is a key factor for winning championships.\nLet’s take a look at wins versus losses for all teams in the NHL over the past 5 years, showing which teams turn goals into wins and which teams struggle to do so.\nSpecifically, where do the past five Stanley Cup Winners rank amongst the rest of the league?\n\n\nCode\nstats &lt;- read_csv(\"SPMC 350 Project #2 Data - Sheet4.csv\")\n\nwins_losses &lt;- stats |&gt;\n  group_by(Team) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    Wins = sum(W),\n    Losses = sum(L)\n  )\n\nchamps &lt;- wins_losses |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Vegas Golden Knights\" | Team == \"Florida Panthers\" | Team == \"Colorado Avalanche\" | Team == \"Tampa Bay Lightning\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data = wins_losses,\n    aes(y = reorder(Team, Wins), x = Wins, xend = Losses),\n    size = 1.75,\n    colour = \"#C0C0C0\",\n    colour_x = \"#808080\",\n    colour_xend = \"#71797E\",\n    alpha = .3\n  ) +\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data = champs,\n    aes(y = reorder(Team, Wins), x = Wins, xend = Losses),\n    size = 1.75,\n    colour = \"darkgrey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Wins vs Losses\", \n    y=\"\", \n    title=\"High Offense Doesn’t Guarantee a Championship\", \n    subtitle=\"The Tampa Bay Lightning are the only recent Stanley Cup champions to rank high in shots, goals, and shooting \\npercentage, highlighting that winning the Cup also depends on defense, special teams, and team depth.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Hockey Reference | By Avery Linder\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 19, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 9), \n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, success in the NHL isn’t just about taking more shots or scoring the most goals.\nEfficiency does help, but it’s not the only factor that a balanced team needs. A strong defense, special teams, and roster depth all play a crucial role in a teams’ performance.\nTeams like the Tampa Bay Lightning show that high efficiency and well-rounded play turn into championships. At the same time, the Florida Panthers’ highlight that winning in hockey is about more than just numbers on the scoreboard.\nIn the NHL, balanced game play often matters more than just taking the highest amount of shots."

    "section": "",
    "text": "People often claim that the first half of a basketball game is the most important. But is that actually true?\nIn the Big Ten Men’s Basketball Conference, the early minutes can make or break a team’s night. The first half can set the tone for the final stretch, revealing which programs take early control and which teams spend their time digging themselves out of a hole.\nUnderstanding these patterns, helps highlights the critical role halftime performance plays in a team’s overall season outcome.\nSports Reference data from the 2024–2025 season shows halftime and final scores for every game in the regular season, highlighting which teams turn early leads into victories and which struggle to keep up\nPatterns quickly appear, showing which programs hold their halftime advantage and which fall behind before the final buzzer.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\n\nset.seed(4)\n\nbasketball &lt;- read_csv(\"Project 1 Data - Sheet1.csv\")\n\nbig &lt;- basketball |&gt;\n  filter(HalftimeStatus == \"Winning\") |&gt; \n group_by(Team, Result) |&gt;\n  summarise(total_games = n())\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=big, aes(x=reorder(Team, total_games), weight = total_games, fill=Result)) + \n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Number of Games\", \n    title=\"Big Ten Teams Thrive When Ahead at the Break\", \n    subtitle=\"Teams like Michigan State, Wisconsin and Maryland often convert halftime leads into victories. \\nMeanwhile, Nebraska, rarely finds itself ahead at the break.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Avery Linder\"\n    ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"#939598\", \"#0088CE\")) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 9), \n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome Big Ten teams consistently build on early advantages, while others rarely find themselves ahead at the break.\nNebraska often falls behind early, making it difficult for them to turn games around, while programs like Michigan State and Wisconsin tend to carry early leads to the finish. Starting strong clearly gives momentum, while trailing at halftime can set the tone for the rest of the game.\nThis pattern becomes more clear when looking at how often teams hold a halftime lead compared to how frequently they win.\n\n\nCode\nbasketball &lt;- read_csv(\"Project 1 Data - Sheet1.csv\")\n\nteams &lt;- basketball |&gt; \n  group_by(Team) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    GamesPlayed = n(),\n    HalftimeLeadPct = mean(HalftimeStatus == \"Winning\"),\n    WinPct = mean(Result == \"Win\") \n  )\n\nnebraska &lt;- teams |&gt; filter(Team == \"Nebraska\")\n\nteamavg &lt;- teams |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    avg_HalftimeLeadPct = mean(HalftimeLeadPct),\n    avg_WinPct = mean(WinPct)\n  )\n\nms &lt;- teams |&gt; \n  filter(WinPct &gt; .8)\n\nhalf &lt;- teams |&gt; \n  filter(HalftimeLeadPct &gt; .79)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data = teams, aes(x = HalftimeLeadPct, y = WinPct), color = \"darkgrey\", size = 3) +\n  geom_point(data = nebraska, aes(x = HalftimeLeadPct, y = WinPct), color = \"red\", size = 3) +\n  geom_text_repel(data = nebraska, aes(x = HalftimeLeadPct, y = WinPct, label = Team), size = 4) +\n  geom_point(data = ms, aes(x = HalftimeLeadPct, y = WinPct), color = \"darkgreen\", size = 3) +\n  geom_text_repel(data = ms, aes(x = HalftimeLeadPct, y = WinPct, label = Team), size = 4) +\n  geom_point(data = half, aes(x = HalftimeLeadPct, y = WinPct), color = \"darkred\", size = 3) +\n  geom_text_repel(data = half, aes(x = HalftimeLeadPct, y = WinPct, label = Team), size = 4) +\n  geom_smooth(data= teams, aes(x=HalftimeLeadPct, y=WinPct), method = \"lm\", se=FALSE) +\n    labs(\n    x=\"Halftime Lead Percentage\", \n    y=\"Win Percentage\", \n    title=\"Higher Halftime Lead Rates Align with Higher Win Rates\", \n    subtitle=\"A higher halftime lead percentage translates to a higher win percentage.

Nebraska’s position near the bottom of the Big Ten, shows how early deficits are a challenge to come back from, while teams that create momentum early, are more likely to secure a victory.\nWhile the season-long percentages show which teams usually convert halftime leads into wins, breaking it down into individual games shows even more detail.\nSmall halftime point differentials can swing either way at the end of the game, but larger leads or deficits are much harder to change in the second half.\nNebraska’s struggles are visible with majority of their games showing early deficits leading to losses, with a few exceptions of a comeback.\n\n\nCode\nbasketball &lt;- read_csv(\"Project 1 Data - Sheet1.csv\")\n\nnu &lt;- basketball |&gt; filter(Team == \"Nebraska\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_beeswarm(data = basketball, aes(x = HTPointDiff, y = FinalPointDiff), color = \"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = \"blue\", size = 0.5) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = \"blue\", size = 0.5) +\n  geom_beeswarm(data = nu, aes(x = HTPointDiff, y = FinalPointDiff), color = \"red\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n   labs(\n    x=\"Halftime Point Differential\", \n    y=\"Final Point Differential\", \n    title=\"Nebraska’s Early Game Deficits Predict Final Losses\", \n    subtitle=\"Half-time deficits set the tone for Nebraska’s final outcomes with few games turned around in the second half.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Avery Linder\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 19.5, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 9), \n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, the data shows that the first half of a Big Ten Men’s College Basketball game matters more than just setting the tone. It often predicts the final outcome. Teams that start the game strong have a better chance at winning, while an early deficit leads to a battle for the rest of the game.\nFor Nebraska the data shows both the challenges of falling behind early and some rare times of their fight back to win in the end.\nWill this season be any different for the Cornhuskers?"
