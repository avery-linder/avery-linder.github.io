    "text": "People often claim that the first half of a basketball game is the most important. But is that actually true?\nIn the Big Ten Men’s Basketball Conference, the early minutes can make or break a team’s night. The first half can set the tone for the final stretch, revealing which programs take early control and which teams spend their time digging themselves out of a hole.\nUnderstanding these patterns, helps highlights the critical role halftime performance plays in a team’s overall season outcome.\nSports Reference data from the 2024–2025 season shows halftime and final scores for every game in the regular season, highlighting which teams turn early leads into victories and which struggle to keep up\nPatterns quickly appear, showing which programs hold their halftime advantage and which fall behind before the final buzzer.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\n\nset.seed(4)\n\nbasketball &lt;- read_csv(\"Project 1 Data - Sheet1.csv\")\n\nbig &lt;- basketball |&gt;\n  filter(HalftimeStatus == \"Winning\") |&gt; \n group_by(Team, Result) |&gt;\n  summarise(total_games = n())\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=big, aes(x=reorder(Team, total_games), weight = total_games, fill=Result)) + \n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Number of Games\", \n    title=\"Big Ten Teams Thrive When Ahead at the Break\", \n    subtitle=\"Teams like Michigan State, Wisconsin and Maryland often convert halftime leads into \\nvictories. Meanwhile, Nebraska, rarely finds itself ahead at the break.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Avery Linder\"\n    ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"#939598\", \"#0088CE\")) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 9), \n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome Big Ten teams consistently build on early advantages, while others rarely find themselves ahead at the break.\nNebraska often falls behind early, making it difficult for them to turn games around, while programs like Michigan State and Wisconsin tend to carry early leads to the finish. Starting strong clearly gives momentum, while trailing at halftime can set the tone for the rest of the game.\nThis pattern becomes more clear when looking at how often teams hold a halftime lead compared to how frequently they win.\n\n\nCode\nbasketball &lt;- read_csv(\"Project 1 Data - Sheet1.csv\")\n\nteams &lt;- basketball |&gt; \n  group_by(Team) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    GamesPlayed = n(),\n    HalftimeLeadPct = mean(HalftimeStatus == \"Winning\"),\n    WinPct = mean(Result == \"Win\") \n  )\n\nnebraska &lt;- teams |&gt; filter(Team == \"Nebraska\")\n\nteamavg &lt;- teams |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    avg_HalftimeLeadPct = mean(HalftimeLeadPct),\n    avg_WinPct = mean(WinPct)\n  )\n\nms &lt;- teams |&gt; \n  filter(WinPct &gt; .8)\n\nhalf &lt;- teams |&gt; \n  filter(HalftimeLeadPct &gt; .79)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data = teams, aes(x = HalftimeLeadPct, y = WinPct), color = \"darkgrey\", size = 3) +\n  geom_point(data = nebraska, aes(x = HalftimeLeadPct, y = WinPct), color = \"red\", size = 3) +\n  geom_text_repel(data = nebraska, aes(x = HalftimeLeadPct, y = WinPct, label = Team), size = 4) +\n  geom_point(data = ms, aes(x = HalftimeLeadPct, y = WinPct), color = \"darkgreen\", size = 3) +\n  geom_text_repel(data = ms, aes(x = HalftimeLeadPct, y = WinPct, label = Team), size = 4) +\n  geom_point(data = half, aes(x = HalftimeLeadPct, y = WinPct), color = \"darkred\", size = 3) +\n  geom_text_repel(data = half, aes(x = HalftimeLeadPct, y = WinPct, label = Team), size = 4) +\n  geom_smooth(data= teams, aes(x=HalftimeLeadPct, y=WinPct), method = \"lm\", se=FALSE) +\n    labs(\n    x=\"Halftime Lead Percentage\", \n    y=\"Win Percentage\", \n    title=\"Higher Halftime Lead Rates Align with Higher Win Rates\", \n    subtitle=\"A higher halftime lead percentage translates to a higher win percentage. Nebraska sits near the bottom of the pack.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Avery Linder\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 19, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 9), \n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe relationship is clear: teams that frequently hold a halftime lead tend to finish games successfully, while those that are rarely ahead tend to struggle. Nebraska’s position near the bottom of the Big Ten, shows how early deficits are a challenge to come back from, while teams that create momentum early, are more likely to secure a victory.\nWhile the season-long percentages show which teams usually convert halftime leads into wins, breaking it down into individual games shows even more detail.\nSmall halftime point differentials can swing either way at the end of the game, but larger leads or deficits are much harder to change in the second half.\nNebraska’s struggles are visible with majority of their games showing early deficits leading to losses, with a few exceptions of a comeback.\n\n\nCode\nbasketball &lt;- read_csv(\"Project 1 Data - Sheet1.csv\")\n\nnu &lt;- basketball |&gt; filter(Team == \"Nebraska\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_beeswarm(data = basketball, aes(x = HTPointDiff, y = FinalPointDiff), color = \"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = \"blue\", size = 0.5) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = \"blue\", size = 0.5) +\n  geom_beeswarm(data = nu, aes(x = HTPointDiff, y = FinalPointDiff), color = \"red\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n   labs(\n    x=\"Halftime Point Differential\", \n    y=\"Final Point Differential\", \n    title=\"Nebraska’s Early Game Deficits Predict Final Losses\", \n    subtitle=\"Half-time deficits often set the tone for Nebraska’s final outcomes with few games turned around in the second half.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Avery Linder\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 9), \n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, the data shows that the first half of a Big Ten Men’s College Basketball game matters more than just setting the tone. It often predicts the final outcome. Teams that start the game strong have a better chance at winning, while an early deficit leads to a battle for the rest of the game.\nFor Nebraska the data shows both the challenges of falling behind early and some rare times of their fight back to win in the end.\nWill this season be any different for the Cornhuskers?"
